This program creates an application that interacts with a webservice to obtain data when a user enters either a city or zip code via a request from weather forecast data http://openweathermap.org/. Once the data is obtained, the weather forecast is displayed in a readable format to the user. Further, the program uses comments to specify its courses, uses functions, allows the user to run it multiple times to obtain weather forecast for multiple locations, checks the accuracy of the data the user enters, notifies the user in the event that the data entered is incorrect, and uses the request library to gain data from the webservice.
